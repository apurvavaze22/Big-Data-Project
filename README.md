The course project includes 4 parts. 
Part 1: 
The first part is to develop a Mapper and Reducer application to calculate average visibility distance (meters) for each USAF weather station ID from NCDC records (note: 999999 indicates missing value, and [01459] indicate good quality value). 
Part 2:
The second part is to develop a Mapper and Reducer application to retrieve USAF weather station ID and sky ceiling height (meters) from NCDC records (note: 99999 indicates missing value, and [01459] indicate good quality value) and then write the USAF weather station ID and sky ceiling height data into a text file. 
Part 3: 
The third part is to load the text file into Pig and get the average sky ceiling height for each USAF weather station ID.
Part 4: 
The fourth part is to load the text file into Hive and get the highest and lowest sky ceiling height for each USAF weather station ID.
